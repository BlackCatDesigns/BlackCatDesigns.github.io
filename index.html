                        4.0.1 Intent. The intent of the R1 Single-family Residential Use District is to delineate
                        those areas where predominantly single-family detached, low-density residential
                        development has occurred or is likely to occur in the future. It is to protect the
                        integrity of these residential areas by prohibiting the intrusion of any use which is
                        not compatible with this predominant type and intensity of use. The R1 District
                        recognizes the value of such other permissible uses as churches, schools, libraries
                        and other educational buildings, and playgrounds.

                    the application is complete and whether the application is worthy of further
                    consideration. If the application is deemed to be worthy of further consideration, the
                    common council shall prepare a resolution with required minimum sponsorship and
                    submit that together with two sketch plans prepared by the applicant to the planning
                    board.
                    The first sketch shall show how the site will be developed with the amenity, if it is on
                    site, and the incentive. The plan shall also show existing development, property owner's
                    names and tax account numbers for all property within 200 feet of the property lines of
                    the proposed project or such other distance specified by the common council.
                    If the incentive will result in a structural height increase, the applicant shall submit an
                    elevation drawing at a scale of 1/4 inch equal one inch which shows the height permitted
                    by the district regulations, the proposed additional height, the distance to other principal
                    structures on-site and on adjacent properties and their heights, as well as property line
                    locations.
                    If the incentive will result in a setback or open space reduction, the drawing shall show
                    this reduction in relation to the principal structures on-site and on adjacent properties, as
                    well as property line locations.
                    The second sketch plan should show existing development, property owners' names, and
                    tax account numbers for all property within 200 feet of the property line at the project
                    site, or such other distance as specified by the common council; but shall only show how
                    the site would be developed exclusive of any amenity or incentive.
                    The applicant shall also submit such additional information and plans as may be required
                    by the planning board which, in its judgment, are necessary in order to perform a
                    thorough evaluation of the proposal.

                    and how they relate to adjacent uses and structures. The planning board's review shall be
                    limited to the planning, design and layout considerations involved with project review
                    and such other issues as may be specifically referred by the common council. The
                    planning board's report shall be submitted to the common council within 70 days from
                    the date the application by the applicant to the common council is determined to be
                    complete. This time period may be extended/suspended for good cause by the common
                    council.
                    The common council will review the planning board's report. The common council will
                    notify the applicant whether it is willing to further consider the proposal and hold a

                    and common council, the applicant may submit a final plan for review and approval.
                    If the common council finds that a community benefit is not suitable on site or cannot be
                    reasonably provided, the common council may require a cash payment in lieu of the
                    provision of the amenity. These funds shall be placed in a trust fund to be used by the city

                    low density single-family residential districts which may be added to the city through
                    annexation. The Planned Residential District provides for somewhat lower density
                    residential single-family development than the R1, R2 or R3 Districts, in keeping with
                    the environmental and topographical characteristics of the hillside areas adjacent to the
                    present city boundaries. It is the intent of this article that developments in areas where
                    these regulations are applicable respect the preservation of unique views which are
                    integral to the natural heritage of the city and the character and density of surrounding
                    areas. The PR District use and density control regulations are intended to apply to new
                    zoning designations subject to full review and approval by the common council of the
                    city. They are applicable to any area which may be annexed in the future by the city
                    where lower density residential development will meet the objectives of this article.

                    It is the intent of this article that use regulations and density controls be established for
                    planned business districts which may be added to the city through annexation. The
                    Planned Business District provides for mixed-use business and industrial park
                    developments along regional arterial roads in keeping with the environmental
                    characteristics of areas most suitable for consideration for annexation as development
                    occurs in future years. It is the intent of this article that developments in areas where
                    these regulations are applicable respect the character and density of surrounding areas.
                    The PB Use District use and density control regulations are intended to apply to new
                    zoning designations subject to full review and approval by the common council of the
                    city. They are applicable to any area which may be annexed in the future by the city
                    where business development will meet the objectives of this article.

                Pursuant to the city laws and in accordance with the general City Law of the State of 
                New York, as amended, the city shall have a planning board. The planning board will 
                consist of seven members appointed by the mayor with the approval of a majority of the 
                common council. The term of office is seven years. Appointments will be in a manner so 
                that one member's term expires each succeeding year. If a vacancy occurs for a reason 
                other than the expiration of a term, it will be filled by mayoral appointment for the 
                remainder of the unexpired term. Members must be residents of the city. Members may 
                not be members of the common council. The mayor and common council may provide 
                for compensation to be paid to members, experts, clerks, and a secretary and provide for 
                such other expenses as may be necessary and proper, not exceeding the appropriation 
                made by the mayor and common council for his purpose. The mayor will designate a 
                chairperson from among the members of the planning board, and in the absence of the 
                chairperson, the planning board may designate a member to serve as chairperson. The 
                appointment of chairperson is for a one-year term.

                        9.0.1 Purpose and intent. The purpose of special use approval is to allow the proper
                        integration into the community of uses which may be suitable only under certain
                        conditions and at appropriate locations. Because of their unusual characteristics, or
                        the special characteristics of the area in which they are to be located, special uses
                        require special consideration so that they may be properly located with respect to
                        the objectives of this zoning chapter and their effect on nearby properties.
                    </p>

                        9.0.2 Authorization to grant or deny special uses. The planning board is hereby
                        authorized to approve special uses. The special uses listed in this zoning law may
                        be permitted, enlarged, or otherwise altered upon authorization by the planning
                        board in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in this section. In
                        permitting a special use or the modification of a special use, the planning board
                        may impose those standards and requirements expressly specified by this law and
                        any additional conditions which the planning board considers necessary and
                        reasonable to protect the best interests of the surrounding property, the
                        neighborhood, or the city as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not
                        limited to, size or controlling the location and number of vehicle access points,
                        increasing the street width, limiting the number, size and location of signs, limiting
                        hours of operation, and required fencing, screening and landscaping or other
                        facilities to protect adjacent or nearby property. In the case of a use existing prior to
                        the effective date of this law change in use or in lot area or an alteration of structure
                        shall conform with the requirements dealing with special uses.
                        The duration of an approved special use permit shall be six months or such greater
                        period not to exceed one year as may be specified in the approval by the planning board.
                        Special use permit approval may be renewed by the planning board for a period of six
                        months upon written application to the planning board and copies to the code
                        enforcement officer, such application to be submitted prior to the expiration of the special
                        use permit approval period.
                        On application, and after public notice and hearing, the planning board may authorize
                        the issuance by the code enforcement officer of permits for any of the special uses for
                        which this law requires such permits.

                                the original special use permit was granted.
