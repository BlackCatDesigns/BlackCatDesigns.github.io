                        4.0.1 Intent. The intent of the R1 Single-family Residential Use District is to delineate
                        those areas where predominantly single-family detached, low-density residential
                        development has occurred or is likely to occur in the future. It is to protect the
                        integrity of these residential areas by prohibiting the intrusion of any use which is
                        not compatible with this predominant type and intensity of use. The R1 District

                        and other educational buildings, and playgrounds.

                The common council shall review the proposal and inform the applicant whether or not
                the application is complete and whether the application is worthy of further
                consideration. If the application is deemed to be worthy of further consideration, the
                common council shall prepare a resolution with required minimum sponsorship and
                submit that together with two sketch plans prepared by the applicant to the planning
                board.
                The first sketch shall show how the site will be developed with the amenity, if it is on
                site, and the incentive. The plan shall also show existing development, property owner's
                names and tax account numbers for all property within 200 feet of the property lines of
                the proposed project or such other distance specified by the common council.
                If the incentive will result in a structural height increase, the applicant shall submit an
                elevation drawing at a scale of 1/4 inch equal one inch which shows the height permitted
                by the district regulations, the proposed additional height, the distance to other principal
                structures on-site and on adjacent properties and their heights, as well as property line
                locations.
                If the incentive will result in a setback or open space reduction, the drawing shall show
                this reduction in relation to the principal structures on-site and on adjacent properties, as
                well as property line locations.
                The second sketch plan should show existing development, property owners' names, and
                tax account numbers for all property within 200 feet of the property line at the project
                site, or such other distance as specified by the common council; but shall only show how
                the site would be developed exclusive of any amenity or incentive.
                The applicant shall also submit such additional information and plans as may be required
                by the planning board which, in its judgment, are necessary in order to perform a
                thorough evaluation of the proposal.
                The planning board shall review the proposal and report to the common council with their
                evaluation of the adequacy with which the amenity or amenities and incentives fit the site
                and how they relate to adjacent uses and structures. The planning board's review shall be
                limited to the planning, design and layout considerations involved with project review
                and such other issues as may be specifically referred by the common council. The
                planning board's report shall be submitted to the common council within 70 days from
                the date the application by the applicant to the common council is determined to be
                complete. This time period may be extended/suspended for good cause by the common
                council.
                The common council will review the planning board's report. The common council will
                notify the applicant whether it is willing to further consider the proposal and hold a
                public hearing thereon.

                For common council public hearings on incentive zoning requests, the city clerk shall
                give notice of the hearing in the official newspaper of the city at least 10 days prior to the
                date of the hearing.
                All applicable requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) Act shall
                be complied with as part of the review and hearing process. In addition to other
                information that may be required as part of an environmental assessment of the proposal,
                the assessment shall include verification that the area has adequate sewer, water,
                transportation, waste disposal and fire protection facilities to, first, serve the remaining
                vacant land in the district as though it were developed to its fullest potential under the
                district regulations in effect at the time of the amenity/incentive proposal; and then, serve
                the on-site amenity and incentive.

                <h6>Sec. 5.7.  Final common council action.</h6>
                Following the hearing and in addition to compliance with all SEQR requirements, the
                common council shall, before taking action, refer the proposal for review and comment to
                other governmental agencies as may be required, and may refer the proposal to other
                agencies for review and comment. In order to approve an amenity incentive proposal, the
                common council shall determine that the proposed amenity provides sufficient public
                benefit to provide the requested incentive. Thereafter, the planning board is authorized to
                act on an application for preliminary plan approval.
                Following preliminary plan approval and subject to meeting all conditions imposed on
                the preliminary plan, including the provision by the applicant of a performance bond to
                guarantee completion of the amenities and all documentation required by the city attorney
                and common council, the applicant may submit a final plan for review and approval.
                If the common council finds that a community benefit is not suitable on site or cannot be
                reasonably provided, the common council may require a cash payment in lieu of the
                provision of the amenity. These funds shall be placed in a trust fund to be used by the city
                upon approval by the common council exclusively for amenities specified in these
                provisions. Cash payments shall be made prior to the issuance of a building permit.

                    <h6>Sec. 7.0.  Intent.</h6>
                    It is the intent of this article that use regulations and density controls be established for
                    low density single-family residential districts which may be added to the city through
                    annexation. The Planned Residential District provides for somewhat lower density
                    residential single-family development than the R1, R2 or R3 Districts, in keeping with
                    the environmental and topographical characteristics of the hillside areas adjacent to the
                    present city boundaries. It is the intent of this article that developments in areas where
                    these regulations are applicable respect the preservation of unique views which are
                    integral to the natural heritage of the city and the character and density of surrounding
                    areas. The PR District use and density control regulations are intended to apply to new
                    zoning designations subject to full review and approval by the common council of the
                    city. They are applicable to any area which may be annexed in the future by the city
                    where lower density residential development will meet the objectives of this article.

                    <h6>Sec. 8.0.  Intent.</h6>
                    It is the intent of this article that use regulations and density controls be established for
                    planned business districts which may be added to the city through annexation. The
                    Planned Business District provides for mixed-use business and industrial park
                    developments along regional arterial roads in keeping with the environmental
                    characteristics of areas most suitable for consideration for annexation as development
                    occurs in future years. It is the intent of this article that developments in areas where
                    these regulations are applicable respect the character and density of surrounding areas.
                    The PB Use District use and density control regulations are intended to apply to new
                    zoning designations subject to full review and approval by the common council of the
                    city. They are applicable to any area which may be annexed in the future by the city
                    where business development will meet the objectives of this article.

                    Pursuant to the city laws and in accordance with the general City Law of the State of 
                    New York, as amended, the city shall have a planning board. The planning board will 
                    consist of seven members appointed by the mayor with the approval of a majority of the 
                    common council. The term of office is seven years. Appointments will be in a manner so 
                    that one member's term expires each succeeding year. If a vacancy occurs for a reason 
                    other than the expiration of a term, it will be filled by mayoral appointment for the 
                    remainder of the unexpired term. Members must be residents of the city. Members may 
                    not be members of the common council. The mayor and common council may provide 
                    for compensation to be paid to members, experts, clerks, and a secretary and provide for 
                    such other expenses as may be necessary and proper, not exceeding the appropriation 
                    made by the mayor and common council for his purpose. The mayor will designate a 
                    chairperson from among the members of the planning board, and in the absence of the 
                    chairperson, the planning board may designate a member to serve as chairperson. The 
                    appointment of chairperson is for a one-year term. 
                    <p class="sec9hi">
                        9.0.1 Purpose and intent. The purpose of special use approval is to allow the proper
                        integration into the community of uses which may be suitable only under certain
                        conditions and at appropriate locations. Because of their unusual characteristics, or
                        the special characteristics of the area in which they are to be located, special uses
                        require special consideration so that they may be properly located with respect to
                        the objectives of this zoning chapter and their effect on nearby properties.

                        9.0.2 Authorization to grant or deny special uses. The planning board is hereby
                        authorized to approve special uses. The special uses listed in this zoning law may
                        be permitted, enlarged, or otherwise altered upon authorization by the planning
                        board in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in this section. In
                        permitting a special use or the modification of a special use, the planning board
                        may impose those standards and requirements expressly specified by this law and
                        any additional conditions which the planning board considers necessary and
                        reasonable to protect the best interests of the surrounding property, the
                        neighborhood, or the city as a whole. These conditions may include, but are not
                        limited to, size or controlling the location and number of vehicle access points,
                        increasing the street width, limiting the number, size and location of signs, limiting
                        hours of operation, and required fencing, screening and landscaping or other
                        facilities to protect adjacent or nearby property. In the case of a use existing prior to
                        the effective date of this law change in use or in lot area or an alteration of structure
                        shall conform with the requirements dealing with special uses.
                        The duration of an approved special use permit shall be six months or such greater
                        period not to exceed one year as may be specified in the approval by the planning board.
                        Special use permit approval may be renewed by the planning board for a period of six
                        months upon written application to the planning board and copies to the code
                        enforcement officer, such application to be submitted prior to the expiration of the special
                        use permit approval period.
                        On application, and after public notice and hearing, the planning board may authorize
                        the issuance by the code enforcement officer of permits for any of the special uses for
                        which this law requires such permits.

                                c. Before a special use is permitted the proposed special use shall be subject to

                                section 9.1.6.

                                first holding a public hearing and giving notice of such hearing. The forgoing

                10.24.1  Intent. The City of Olean recognizes the increased demand for wireless
                communication transmitting facilities and the need for the services they provide.
                Often, these facilities require the construction of a communications tower and/or
                similar facilities. The intent of this section is to regulate telecommunications
                facilities in accordance with the guidelines of the Telecommunication Act of 1996
                by:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        1. Accommodating the need for telecommunication towers/antennas while
                        regulating their location and number in the community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2. Minimizing adverse visual impacts of these towers/antennas through proper
                        design, siting and screening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3. Preserving and enhancing the positive aesthetic qualities of the built and
                        natural environment in the City of Olean.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4. Avoiding potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure, falling
                        ice, etc., through engineering and proper siting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        5. Requiring the joint use of towers when available, and encouraging the
                        placement of antennas on existing structures, to reduce the number of such
                        structures in the future. No new tower may be established without proof that
                        reasonable efforts have been made to co-locate with an existing
                        telecommunications facility or upon an existing structure.
                    </li>
                </ul>
               
                This Section 10.24 shall be an addition to and not replace any other federal,
                state, or local requirement, approval and/or consent related to a covered
                telecommunication facility, including, without limitation, code enforcement compliance,
                overlay district requirements, and design district requirements.
                In the event a facility is to be located in an Industrial 3 (I3) District, Section
                <p class="sec10hi">
                    10.12.3 of this chapter shall be applicable in addition to this Section 10.24 as well as any
                    other local requirements, approvals and/or consents.

                <p class="sec10hi">
                    10.24.2  Non-co-located/new structure antennas. An antenna that will not be
                    mounted on an existing structure or is more than 50 feet higher than the existing
                    structure on which it is mounted is permitted as follows:

                        property lines and existing building(s).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3. The maximum height of a tower is 175 feet. A variance for height will be
                        required from the Zoning Board of Appeals to exceed this height following
                        initial review by the Planning Board.

                    <li>
                        5. The application shall include an adequate inventory report specifying existing
                        telecommunication facility sites and structures of height exceeding 75% of the
                        height of the proposed tower within a one-mile radius from the proposed site
                        if the application is for cellular telephone or personal communications use, or
                        a five-mile radius for all other services. The inventory report shall contain an
                        evaluation of opportunities for shared use as an alternative to the proposed
                        location.

                    <li>
                        6. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed telecommunication facility
                        cannot be accommodated on all existing sites in the inventory due to one or
                        more of the following reasons:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                a. The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of existing
                                and approved telecommunication facilities or other structures,
                                considering existing and planned use for those facilities;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                b. The planned equipment would cause radio frequency interference with
                                other existing or planned equipment, which cannot be reasonably
                                prevented;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                c. Existing or approved telecommunication facilities or other structures do
                                not have space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can
                                function effectively and reasonably;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                d. Other technical reasons make it impracticable to place the equipment
                                proposed by the applicant on existing facilities or structures;
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        1. Siting preferences: The City may express a preference that the proposed
                        telecommunications facility be located in an alternate technologically feasible
                        and available location. A guideline for the City's preference, from most
                        favorable to least favorable districts/property, is as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Property with an existing structure suitable for co-location;</li>
